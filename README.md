# Html2md API Documentation

**This collection is intended to test markdown styling inside our engine or
within other services that render Markdown. The descriptions in this
collection contain markdown syntax and some of them have links to HTML pages
of their rendered version.**

If you want to test Markdown, use provided routes at http://api.html2md.tech/test_convert

Also, developers love Github Markdown Styling:
that's our priority!

## A guide to get you hit the ground running with parsing markdown

* * *

# This is an h1 header

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. _Italic_ , **bold** , and `monospace`. Itemized lists look
like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text content starts
at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs, if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all in
chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis. Unicode is
supported. â˜º

## This is an  h2 header

Here's a numbered list:

  * first item
  * second item
  * third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters from the
left side). Here's a code sample:

Plain Text

_ __ _

    
    
    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of indenting
the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

Plain Text

_ __ _

    
    
    define foobar() {
        print "Welcome to html2md, here feels a little different! You can click somewhere top right to copy me. awesome stuff!";
    }

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the delimited
block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

python

_ __ _

    
    
    import time
    # Quick, count to ten!
    for i in range(10):
        # (but not *too* quick)
        time.sleep(0.5)
        print i

### This is an h3 header

#### Write me a recipe!
Now a nested list:
  * First, get these ingredients:

    * carrots
    * celery
    * lentils
  * Boil some water.

  * Dump everything in the pot and follow this algorithm:

Plain Text

_ __ _

    #### The story continues!
    find wooden spoon
    uncover pot
    stir
    cover pot
    balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
    wait 10 minutes
    goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including that last
line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a link to a website, to a local doc, and to a section heading in the
current doc. Here's a footnote [^1].

[^1]: Footnote text goes here.

Tables can look like this:

size material color

* * *

9 leather brown 10 hemp canvas natural 11 glass transparent

Table: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of

(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports multi-line
tables:

* * *

keyword text

* * *

red Sunsets, apples, and other red or reddish things.

green Leaves, grass, frogs and other things it's not easy being.

* * *

A horizontal rule follows.

* * *

Here's a definition list:

apples : Good for making applesauce. oranges : Citrus! tomatoes : There's no
"e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term/definition pair to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block":

| Line one | Line too | Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

![example image](https://www.getpostman.com/img/v2/#)

Inline math equations go in like so: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display math
should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters which you
wish to be displayed literally, ex.: `foo`, *bar*, etc.
