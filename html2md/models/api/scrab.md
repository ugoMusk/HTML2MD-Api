**Lyrics**

The needle surfs  
A vinyl wave  
Riding a groove  
To set the mood  
  
The sounds I hear  
Flow through my ears  
To the corners of my mind  
  
Take me beyond  
The edge of my world  
You lit a flame and set my soul on fire  
  
Burning more brightly  
Than ever before  
A shooting star  
In the dark of a winter's night  
  
The spiral's got me  
Hypnotized  
The whirlpool spins  
And pulls me in  
  
I catch my breath  
And close my eyes  
Swirling in the sound  
  
Take me beyond  
The edge of my world  
You lit a flame and set my soul on fire  
  
Burning more brightly  
Than ever before  
A shooting star  
In the dark of a winter's night  
  
From peaks to valleys  
Sky to sea  
Traveling through  
These melodies  
  
I had no voice  
But now I'm free  
Singing a song of my own  
  
Take me beyond  
The edge of my world  
You lit a flame and set my soul on fire  
  
Burning more brightly  
Than ever before  
A shooting star  
In the dark of a winter's night
